					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article compiled all the basics of animations in webpages and different interfaces. Different features such as easing, 
								the bouncing effect, and motion blur all are subtle features but can have a positive or negative impact on a user's experience. It 
								was particularly interesting learning about the cubic bezier curves and how different combinations can create really cool animations.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really liked seeing the "good" and the "bad" animations next to each other. The animations really displayed how a minor effect
								can keep a user interested or not. I liked seeing the science behind design and animation. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface." </p>
						</li>
