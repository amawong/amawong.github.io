            <li>I learned that when creating a product, designers focus on hierarchy, content, intent, and audience. These categories are very user-centered
                and make sure users will have an aesthetic and efficient experience.
            </li>
            <li>My favorite part of this article was decontructing apps that I use pretty often. I was able to really focus on 
                different features and design choices that I otherwise don't really notice.</li>
            <li>"be curious about everything you see"</li>
            <li>I'd rate this article 8/10. It was short, concise, and kept me engaged.</li>
