                            <p> This article displayed different UI layouts. Some layouts were for websites and others were for mobile apps.
                                Different animations and features were highlighted in a series of GIFs. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I do like how there's no reading. Sometimes images are just simpler. Other than that, I like the GIF feature that shows us how 
                                certain animations work and flow.
                            </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>I really liked the add to cart interaction, the easygrow.io app, and the Shazam style shopping UI. The add to cart interaction has a very 
                                cool animation for when users want to add an item to their cart and when they want to look at the different color selections. The easygrow.io 
                                app has seamless transitions from each plant to the next and easily displays their stats. The Shazam style shopping is a very cool idea and I like how
                                the app offers clothing suggestions based off the picture as well.
