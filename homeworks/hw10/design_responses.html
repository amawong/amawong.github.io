							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed this article and especially enjoy learning about this topic since I love exploring human psychology and how the human
								brain works. I wouldn't say this article particularly influenced my opinion. However, I do feel very informed about how to incorporate 
								this science of attention into my own designs. The Hick's Law is an example that I personally experience. Sometimes an overwhelming amount
								of choices will deter me. </p>
